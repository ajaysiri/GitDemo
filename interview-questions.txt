What is the Port channel?  (port channel will be configured between Fex [nothing but iom(input output module in blade chassis)] and FI
							also we can configure between ethernet uplink ports in FI to north bound switches example nxos-5000 or NXOS-7000)
							by configuring portchannel we will achive redundancy,loadbalance
How FI is configured.      (fresh deployment of FI from scratch by using setup command)

What is service profile and what does it contain?                it is a template which contains the setting to configure blade or rack server

																 if we did de-association then physical server comeout from all configured settings and the same 
																 service profile we can assign to another server
																 it contains,nic,hba,mac,mgmt ip,booting policy,maintenance policy,bios info,raid policy etc
